# genericides.org
At https://www.genericides.org/ we collect the brand names that have become a generic term for a kind of product or service. We investigate en document cases of trademark generalisation, trademark erosion, or genericide. Examples include [zoom](genericides.org/trademark/zoom), [escalator](https://genericides.org/trademark/escalator), and [appstore](https://genericides.org/index.php/trademark/appstore)

##Our goal
To reach our goal, we will:

*collect the most complete list of genericides all around the world;
*follow the popularity of the terms on the list by regular surveys;
*and make our information universally accessible.

##How
Our brand and trademark knowledge are collected by a diverse network: volunteers from countries in different continents, as well as experts and professionals in the field.
